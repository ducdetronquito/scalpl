Overview
~~~~~~~~


**Scalpl** provides a **lightweight wrapper** that helps you to operate
on **nested dictionaries** seamlessly **through the built-in** ``dict``
**API**, by using dot-separated string keys.

It's not a drop-in replacement for your dictionnaries, just syntactic
sugar to avoid ``this['annoying']['kind']['of']['things']`` and
``prefer['a.different.approach']``.

No conversion cost, a thin computation overhead: that's **Scalpl** in a
nutshell.


Benefits
~~~~~~~~

There are a lot of good libraries to operate on nested dictionaries,
such as `Addict <https://github.com/mewwts/addict>`_ or 
`Box <https://github.com/cdgriffith/Box>`_ , but if you give **Scalpl**
a try, you will find it:

* üöÄ Powerful as the standard dict API
* ‚ö° Lightweight
* üëå Well tested


Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Scalpl** is a Python3 library that you can install via ``pip``

.. code:: sh

    pip3 install scalpl


Usage
~~~~~

**Scalpl** provides a simple class named **Cut** that wraps around your dictionary
and handles operations on nested ``dict`` and that can cut accross ``list`` item.

This wrapper strictly follows the standard ``dict``
`API <https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#dict>`_, which
means you can operate seamlessly on ``dict``,
``collections.defaultdict`` or ``collections.OrderedDict`` by using their methods
with dot-separated keys.
 
Let's see what it looks like with an example ! üëá

.. code:: python

    from scalpl import Cut

    data = {
        'pokemon': [
            {
                'name': 'Bulbasaur',
                'type': ['Grass', 'Poison'],
                'category': 'Seed',
                'ability': 'Overgrow'
            },
            {   
                'name': 'Charmander',
                'type': 'Fire',
                'category': 'Lizard',
                'ability': 'Blaze',
            },
            {
                'name': 'Squirtle',
                'type': 'Water',
                'category': 'Tiny Turtle',
                'ability': 'Torrent',
            }
        ],
        'trainers': [
            {
                'name': 'Ash',
                'hometown': 'Pallet Town'
            }
        ]
    }
    # Just wrap your data, and you're ready to go deeper !
    proxy = Cut(data)

You can use the built-in ``dict`` API to access its values.

.. code:: python

    proxy['pokemon[0].name']
    # 'Bulbasaur'
    proxy.get('pokemon[1].sex', 'Unknown')
    # 'Unknown'
    'trainers[0].hometown' in proxy
    # True

By default, **Scalpl** uses dot as a key separator, but you are free to
use a different character that better suits your needs.

.. code:: python

    # You just have to provide one when you wrap your data.
    proxy = Cut(data, sep='->')
    # Yarrr!
    proxy['pokemon[0]->name']

You can also easily create or update any key/value pair.

.. code:: python

    proxy['pokemon[1].weaknesses'] = ['Ground', 'Rock', 'Water']
    proxy['pokemon[1].weaknesses']
    # ['Ground', 'Rock', 'Water']
    proxy.update({
        'trainers[0].region': 'Kanto',
    })


Following its purpose in the standard API, the *setdefault* method allows
you to create any missing dictionary when you try to access a nested key.

.. code:: python

    proxy.setdefault('pokemon[2].moves.Scratch.power', 40)
    # 40


And it is still possible to iterate over your data.

.. code:: python

    proxy.items()
    # [('pokemon', [...]), ('trainers', [...])]
    proxy.keys()
    # ['pokemon', 'trainers']
    proxy.values()
    # [[...], [...]]

By the way, if you have to operate on a list of dictionaries, the
``Cut.all`` method is what you are looking for.

.. code:: python

    # Let's teach these pokemon some sick moves !
    for pokemon in proxy.all('pokemon'):
        pokemon.setdefault('moves.Scratch.power', 40)

Also, you can remove a specific or an arbitrary key/value pair.

.. code:: python

    proxy.pop('pokemon[0].category')
    # 'Seed'
    proxy.popitem()
    # ('trainers', [...])
    del proxy['pokemon[1].type']

Because **Scalpl** is only a wrapper around your data, it means you can
get it back at will without any conversion cost. If you use an external
API that operates on dictionary, it will just work.

.. code:: python

    import json
    json.dumps(proxy.data)
    # "{'pokemon': [...]}"

Finally, you can retrieve a shallow copy of the inner dictionary or
remove all keys.

.. code:: python

    shallow_copy = proxy.copy()

    proxy.clear()


Benchmark
~~~~~~~~~

This humble benchmark is an attempt to give you an overview of the performance
of `Scalpl <https://github.com/ducdetronquito/scalpl>`_ compared to `Addict <https://github.com/mewwts/addict>`_,
`Box <https://github.com/cdgriffith/Box>`_ and the built-in ``dict``.

It will summarize the *number of operations per second* that each library is 
able to perform on a portion of the JSON dump of the `Python subreddit main page <https://www.reddit.com/r/Python.json>`_.

You can run this benchmark on your machine with the following command:

    python3 ./benchmarks/performance_comparison.py

Here are the results obtained on an AMD 5950x with **Python 3.10.2**.


**Addict** 2.4.0::

    instantiate:--------       773,292  ops per second.
    get:---------------- 1,197,604,715  ops per second.
    get through list:---   647,249,139  ops per second.
    set:----------------   130,434,783  ops per second.
    set through list:---    91,240,875  ops per second.


**Box** 6.0.1::

    instantiate:---------    382,330  ops per second.
    get:----------------- 57,853,629  ops per second.
    get through list:---- 25,509,119  ops per second.
    set:----------------- 29,902,815  ops per second.
    set through list:---- 18,625,442  ops per second.


**Scalpl** latest::

    instantiate:-------- 367,421,940  ops per second.
    get:----------------  71,882,113  ops per second.
    get through list:---  37,406,484  ops per second.
    set:----------------  68,681,318  ops per second.
    set through list:---  40,647,652  ops per second.


**dict**::

    instantiate:---------   612,870,255  ops per second.
    get:----------------- 1,675,977,835  ops per second.
    get through list:----   746,268,647  ops per second.
    set:----------------- 1,388,888,605  ops per second.
    set through list :---   798,934,707  ops per second.


As a conclusion and despite being an order of magniture slower than the built-in
``dict``, **Scalpl** is faster than Box and Addict by an order of magnitude for any operations.
Besides, the gap increase in favor of **Scalpl** when wrapping large dictionaries.

Keeping in mind that this benchmark may vary depending on your use-case, it is very unlikely that
**Scalpl** will become a bottleneck of your application.


Frequently Asked Questions:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* **What if my keys contain dots ?**
    If your keys contain a lot of dots, you should use an other
    key separator when wrapping your data::

        proxy = Cut(data, sep='->')
        proxy['computer->network->127.0.0.1']

    Otherwise, split your key in two part::

        proxy = Cut(data)
        proxy['computer.network']['127.0.0.1']

* **What if my keys contain spaces ?**::
    
    proxy = Cut(data)
    proxy['it works perfectly'] = 'fine'
